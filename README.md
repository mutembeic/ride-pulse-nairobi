## Helping Boda-Boda Riders Find Customers Faster

RidePulse Nairobi is a smart map tool created to help boda-boda riders in Nairobi reduce the time and fuel spent looking for passengers. It uses past trip data to predict where riders are most likely to get customers in the city.

### Why This Is Important

Riders often waste fuel and time looking for passengers or crowd in the same busy areas. RidePulse helps solve this by showing riders where there is real demand.

### How It Works

- **Predicts Busy Areas:** It looks at patterns from thousands of rides and guesses where people will need rides at different times.
- **Shows a Simple Map:** The map uses colors to guide the rider:
  - **Red/Orange:** Lots of customers here – go!
  - **Yellow:** Some demand – possible chance.
  - **Blue/Clear:** Few or no customers – avoid.

### The Goal

1. Help riders make more money.
2. Save fuel and time.
3. Reduce overcrowding in traditional hotspots.

### Where the Data Comes From

We use real delivery data from over 20,000 rides in Nairobi. This includes where and when pickups happened.

### Tools Behind the Scenes

- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Mapping: Folium, H3 grid zones
- Interface: Streamlit web app

RidePulse uses smart tools to make your job easier.
